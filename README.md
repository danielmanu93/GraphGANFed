# GraphGANFed
Design of a molecular generative framework that integrates federated learning into generative adversarial network and graph convolutional network to generate highly novel and diverse molecular samples that can be further explored to accelerate drug discovery efforts. The generated molecules are evaluated using benchmark drug evaluation metrics such as validity, uniqueness, diversity, novelty, drug-likeliness and LogP scores.
