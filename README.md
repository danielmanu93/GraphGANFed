# GraphGANFed
Design of a federated deep generative framework called GraphGANFed that integrates federated learning into generative adversarial network and graph convolutional network to generate highly novel and diverse molecular samples that can be further synthesized to accelerate drug discovery efforts. The generated molecules are evaluated using benchmark drug evaluation metrics such as validity, uniqueness, diversity, novelty, drug-likeliness and LogP scores. 

The results show that our proposed GraphGANFed framework generates novel and diverse molecular samples. Also, we performed case study on some representative molecular samples generated by GraphGANFed based on a case study and the results show that the molecules have high drug likeliness which demonstrates their potental as drug candidates. Moreover, the generated molecules have high LogP scores which indicates improved membrane permeability, which is a desirable property for drug candidates. This shows that the generated molecules have promising pharmacokinetic properties which makes them better candidates for further evaluation in drug development.
